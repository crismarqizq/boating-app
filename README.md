# ⛵️ Fullstack project: Boating-app ⚓️

## 🔎 Intro

This is the final fullstack project where the main objective is to apply everything learnt during the last three months by developing a web app of our choice, in my case, an app were sailors can book their stays in different ports.

### 🌊 Why Boating-app?

The main idea was to mix technology with a field/subject I am really passionate about: the sea.  While thinking about this, I asked myself, if in Internet you can book in different sites the accomodation in-land, what about an app to book stays in port when sailing? And that is how Boating-app was born.

### 🎨 Design

Both Login and Register pages are divided, on the left hand side the form is set. On the right hand, I have used an aerial image of two boats.

#### Color Palette

I have chosen a combination of 4 colours: navy, mid-grey, turqoise and white bone. I think these tones are the perfect match for the theme of the app.
